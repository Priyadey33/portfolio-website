                <h3>Library management system</h3>
                <p>In this project, we made a Library Management system in which various feature like adding books,deleting books were added.Along with it maintained the record of books issued by students and facultie.</p>
                <h4> car rental system using java</h4>
                <p>We developed this project to book a car on rent at the fare charges. In present system all booking work done manually and it takes very hard work to maintain the information of booking and cars. If you want to find which vehicle is available for booking then it takes a lot of time. It only makes the process more difficult and hard. This aim of the project is to automate the work performed in the car rental management system like generating daily bookings, records of car or cab available for booking, record of routes available, rental charges for cars for every route, store record of the customer. It is an offline system and it is basically used by the drivers to earn money</p>
